# Gojira

Gojira is a local browser app that helps open and create multiple Jira tickets quickly and easily without having to wait for a page to load! 

To get Gojira working for your project, click the <b>configure</b> button and  enter your Jira's base URL and a comma-separated list of project prefixes. That's it!

## Installation

* Download the latest zipped version of the app, e.g., GojiraApp1.3.zip  from this repository and extract to a local folder.
* Run `index.html`and bookmark the page
* Click on the **Configure** button and enter the your project information

## Development
Very simple - just checkout the source and run locally. There is no build. Gojira runs on ES6 JavaScript, which is supported by most modern browsers. It uses plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, so no preprocessors and transpilers are required.
