# Gojira

Gojira is a local browser app that helps open and create multiple Jira tickets quickly and easily without having to wait for a page to load! 

After installing, to get Gojira working for your project, click the <b>configure</b> button and  enter your Jira's base URL and a comma-separated list of project prefixes. That's it!

## Installation

* If you just want to run the app, download the zipped version of this repo  (in Github, it's the green **Code** button, then select **Download ZIP**), and extract to a local folder.
* If you plan on doing any development work, clone this repo to a local folder.

## Development
Very simple - just checkout the source and run locally. There is no build. Gojira runs on ES6 JavaScript, which is supported by most modern browsers. It uses plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, so no preprocessors and transpilers are required.
